cd ALS/als-ui
npm run build
```

# Configuring autostart
1. Ensure that project is placed in ~/ALS directory: there should be ALS
and als-ui directories
2. Open ~/.config/openbox/autostart file
3. After the screen configuring lines add following:
```sh
bash /home/<username>/ALS/ALS/als.sh start &
bash /home/<username>/ALS/als-ui/run.sh &
```
4. Reboot the system and ensure that the software has started
